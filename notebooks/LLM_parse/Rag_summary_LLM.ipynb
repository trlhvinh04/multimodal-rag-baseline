      "This table fragment details a list of baseball players who were removed from Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA) consideration for the annual Gold Glove Awards, indicating their exclusion due to either poor performance or ballot expiration. The table tracks whether a player was appearing on the ballot for the first time or was eliminated due to performance, suggesting a ranking system where performance directly impacts eligibility.  Given the context of BBWAA Gold Glove voting, this fragment likely represents a portion of a larger table recording player voting status and performance metrics throughout the year.\n",
