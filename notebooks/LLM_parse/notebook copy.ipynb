    "    Your task is to:\n",
    "    1. Carefully analyze all table fragments based on:\n",
    "    - Column count and alignment\n",
    "    - Content similarity and continuity\n",
    "    - Semantic meaning and context\n",
    "    - Position of headers and repeated patterns\n",
    "    2. Identify which table fragments logically belong to the same original table, regardless of their order in the input.\n",
    "    - For example: Table 1 may need to be merged with Table 6 even if they are not adjacent.\n",
    "    3. Merge those fragments into complete tables while preserving:\n",
    "    - Correct column alignment\n",
    "    - Logical row ordering (based on data flow)\n",
    "    - Data integrity — no duplication or omission of any rows\n",
    "    4. Output only:\n",
    "    - The original input table fragments exactly as provided\n",
    "    - The final merged tables constructed **only from the provided input**\n",
    "    5. Format all output in clean markdown tables.\n",
    "    6. DO NOT add explanations, summaries, interpretations, or generate any new text outside of the tables themselves.\n",
    "    7. DO NOT infer missing rows, extrapolate values, or fill in gaps using context or assumptions.\n",
    "    8. If two tables do not logically belong together, leave them as separate tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Important rules:\n",
    "    - Only use data that appears in the input — do NOT generate new content.\n",
    "    - Do NOT assume that Table 1 must merge with Table 2 — use structural and semantic analysis instead.\n",
    "    - Be careful with empty rows, partial headers, or formatting issues.\n",
    "    - Maintain exact values from the original fragments without modification.\n",

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The user provided several table fragments from a PDF, and my task is to merge them into complete tables if they logically belong together. The key points are to analyze column counts, alignment, content continuity, semantic meaning, and header positions. I need to make sure not to add any new data or assumptions, just work with what's given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the tables provided, let's start by examining each one individually to see their structure and content. \n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with Bảng 1: It has two columns, labeled 0 and 1. The rows under column 0 seem to be empty, while column 1 has text about being elected to the Hall of Fame, eliminated, etc. This looks like a description or notes section, possibly explaining the status of candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bảng 2: Also has two columns, 0 and 1. The content here continues the text from Bảng 1, mentioning ballots and elimination reasons. The symbols like † and * might indicate notes or annotations. Since the content seems to continue from Bảng 1, maybe they are part of the same table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bảng 3: Three columns: 0, 1, 2. Column 0 is empty, column 1 has \"Chipper Jones\" in one row. This might be a list of players, but only one entry is present. It could be part of a larger table, but with only one row, it's unclear yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bảng 4: This table has five columns: 0 (Player), 1 (Votes), 2 (Percent), 3 (Change), 4 (Year). It lists several players with their votes, percentages, and other details. This seems like the main data table, but there are entries like \"Chipper Jones†\" and \"Vladimir Guerrero\" which might be connected to other tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bảng 5: Three columns, similar to Bảng 3, but with \"Vladimir Guerrero\" in column 0. This could be part of the same table as Bảng 3, but with more entries. However, Bảng 5 has only two rows with Vladimir Guerrero and empty rows. Maybe it's a fragment of a larger list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bảng 6: Four columns: 0 (Player), 1 (Votes), 2 (Percent), 3 (Change), 4 (Year). It lists players like Billy Wagner, Scott Rolen, etc., with similar structure to Bảng 4. This might be a continuation of Bảng 4, but with different players.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bảng 7: Three columns, similar to Bảng 3 and 5. It has \"Jim Thome\" in column 0. This could be part of the same list as Bảng 3 and 5, but only one entry here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bảng 8: Three columns, with \"Jack Morris\" in column 0. This might be part of a list similar to Bảng 3, 5, 7, but only one entry.\n",

      "Bảng 10: This has only column 0 with text about the Hall of Fame ballot and class of 2018. It's more like a header or title section, not a data table. So it's probably a standalone table or part of a header, not merged with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's look for patterns. Bảng 4 and Bảng 6 both have similar structures (Player, Votes, Percent, Change, Year) but with different players. Bảng 4 includes Chipper Jones and Vladimir Guerrero, which are also mentioned in Bảng 3 and Bảng 5. Wait, Bảng 3 has \"Chipper Jones\" in column 1, and Bảng 5 has \"Vladimir Guerrero\" in column 0. Bảng 4 has both players. Maybe Bảng 3 and 5 are parts of the same list as Bảng 4? But Bảng 4 has more data. Alternatively, Bảng 3 and 5 might be separate tables with partial entries.\n",

However, the user's example merged tables with similar content, so maybe Bảng 1 and 2 are part of the same table. But the problem is that they are in different structures. Bảng 1 has empty rows and text, while Bảng 2 continues that text. Maybe they are part of the same table, but with different sections.\n",

      "Bảng 3 has \"Chipper Jones\" in column 1, and Bảng 4 has \"Chipper Jones†\" in column 0. If the column headers are different, maybe Bảng 3 is a separate list. But the column headers for Bảng 3 are 0, 1, 2, but the data is only in column 1. So maybe Bảng 3 is a list of players, and Bảng 4 is the main data table with more details. However, Bảng 3's \"Chipper Jones\" is in column 1, while Bảng 4's \"Chipper Jones†\" is in column 0. This might be a different structure, but the player's name is present in both.

However, Bảng 5's column headers are 0, 1, 2, while Bảng 4 has 0 (Player), 1 (Votes), etc. Maybe Bảng 5 is a fragment of the same table as Bảng 4, but with different columns.

      "1. Bảng 1 and Bảng 2: They have similar text and might be merged into a single table with two columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Bảng 4: Main data table with players, votes, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Bảng 6: Another data table with players, votes, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Bảng 9: A separate table with candidate details.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Bảng 3, 5, 7, 8: These might be separate lists or part of other tables, but their structures don't align with Bảng 4 or 6. However, Bảng 3 has \"Chipper Jones\" which is in Bảng 4, so maybe Bảng 3 is part of Bảng 4's data. But the structure is different. Alternatively, Bảng 3, 5, 7, 8 are separate tables with partial entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the user's example merged tables with similar content, maybe Bảng 3 and 5 are part of the same table as Bảng 4. However, Bảng 3 has only one entry, and Bảng 5 has one entry. Maybe they are separate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, Bảng 3, 5, 7, 8 are separate tables with partial entries. Since they don't have matching column headers or structures, they can't be merged.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final answer would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bảng 1 and Bảng 2 merged as one table.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bảng 4 as a separate table.\n",

      "- Bảng 6 as another table.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bảng 9 as another table.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bảng 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 as standalone tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, Bảng 1 and Bảng 2 have similar content and structure (two columns, text). So they can be merged. Bảng 4 and 6 have similar structures (five columns) but different players. Bảng 9 has a different structure. Bảng 3, 5, 7, 8 have different structures. Bảng 10 is a header.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the merged tables would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Bảng 1 + Bảng 2\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Bảng 4\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Bảng 6\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Bảng 9\n",
      "\n",
      "And the rest (Bảng 3, 5, 7, 8, 10) are standalone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But need to check if any of the other tables can be merged. For example, Bảng 3 has \"Chipper Jones\" in column 1, and Bảng 4 has \"Chipper Jones†\" in column 0. Maybe Bảng 3 is a list of players, and Bảng 4 is the main data table. But since the columns don't match, they can't be merged. Similarly, Bảng 5 has \"Vladimir Guerrero\" which is in Bảng 4. But again, different structures.\n",
