The Air Jordan II featured a full-length Air-Sole unit    |\n|                    |        | and a polyurethane midsole. The shoe bore a similar              |\n|                    |        | silhouette to the Nike Air Python that would release the         |\n|                    |        | following year. It featured a faux lizard skin and swooping      |\n|                    |        | lines that resembled the detailing of a sports car. This design  |\n|                    |        | aesthetic would factor into the Air Jordan line later in the     |\n|                    |        | series. The Air Jordan II was the first Jordan not to have the   |\n|                    |        | Nike swoosh on the upper, though \"Nike\" was stitched across      |\n|                    |        | [25]                                                             |\n|                    |        | the heel counter.

During many episodes Will Smith         |\n|                    |        | wore the Metallic Silver, Grape, and Fire Red colorways.

A few    |\n|                    |        | things were no longer featured on the new model, such as         |\n|                    |        | the visible air sole, the Nike Air logo, and the translucent     |\n|                    |        | soles.
