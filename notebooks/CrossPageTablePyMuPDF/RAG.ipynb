Designed by Tinker Hatfield, it was the first Air Jordan released on the global market. It had four colorways: White/Black, Black/Cement Grey, White/Fire Red-Black, and Off White/Military Blue. Nike featured director and actor Spike Lee in ads for the shoe. [27]  Lee had featured the shoe in his movie  Do The Right Thing . [25] Michael Jordan wore the Air Jordan IV when he made \"The Shot\", a series winner in Game 5 of the 1989 NBA First Round between the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Inspired by a WWII Mustang fighter, [25] features include a reflective tongue with a protruding design, translucent rubber soles and lace locks. [28] The Air Jordan V saw a lot of use in popular sitcom  The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air . During many episodes Will Smith wore the Metallic Silver, Grape, and Fire Red colorways. To pay tribute to his character, Jordan released the Air Jordan 5 Bel Air in 2013 and 2020.

[25]  The shoes were worn by the protagonist of the manga  Slam Dunk , Hanamichi Sakuragi. In 2014, Nike released special versions of the VI featuring artwork from the series. [31]  Various other models in the Air Jordan line are featured in the series, including the original Air Jordan, the V, and the XII.

A few things were no longer featured on the new model, such as the visible air sole, the Nike Air logo, and the translucent soles. This was the first Air Jordan in the line that did not have any distinctive \"Nike Air\" branding on the outer portions of the shoe, only on the in-soles. When Jordan went to compete at the 1992 Summer Olympics to play for the US Men\\'s Basketball Team (also known as the \"Dream Team\"), Nike released a special                                                                                               |\\n|                    |        | Olympic color combo of the Air Jordan VII model which had Jordan\\'s Olympic jersey number 9, instead of the usual \"23\" found on other colorways.

The eighth model of the Air Jordan contains a full-length air sole, polyurethane midsole, polycarbonate shank plate, and two crossover straps. The VIIIs were known for a successful ad campaign in which Bugs Bunny appeared alongside Michael Jordan to market the shoes. [25]  The shoe was re-released in 2003, 2007, 2008, 2013, and 2015-2017.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\\n| Air Jordan IX      | 1993   | Originally released in November 1993, the Air Jordan IX was the first model released after Michael Jordan\\'s retirement. Jordan never played an NBA season wearing these shoes. This model was inspired by baseball cleats that Jordan wore when playing minor-league baseball. [25]  The shoe was re- released in 2002, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014-2018. Like the VII and VIII models, the Air Jordan IX featured an inner sock sleeve and nubuck accents.

[25] The shoe was re-released in 2005, 2008, 2012-2016, and 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\\n| Air Jordan XI      | 1995   | This model was designed by Tinker Hatfield. When the shoe launched, Michael Jordan (retired from basketball by then) was with the Birmingham Barons in baseball\\'s minor baseball leagues. Hatfield designed the sneaker waiting for Jordan to come back and hoping he would play in them. [35] The ballistic mesh upper of the sneaker was meant to make the Air Jordan XI lighter and more durable.

The black panther was the inspiration for the Air Jordan XIII, with the sole resembling the pads on a panther\\'s paw. A hologram on the back of the shoe imitates a panther\\'s eyes in the dark. [25]  They were re-released in 2005, which coincided with the release of the Air Jordan 8s shoe. In the movie  He Got Game , director Spike Lee had access to the Air Jordan XIII months before it was available to the public or even worn by Jordan himself and featured it in scenes. [37]                                                                                                                |\\n| Air Jordan XIV     | 1998   | Inspired by the Ferrari 550 M which Michael Jordan owned, the Air Jordan XIV was originally released in October 1998. [25]  It was re-released in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2014-2018. The Air Jordan XIV co-styled by Hatfield and Mark Smith was made race ready and equipped with the Jordan Jumpman insignia on a Ferrari shaped badge. The color scheme of predominant black accentuated with red was nicknamed \"The Last Shot\" because Michael Jordan wore them as he hit the game winning shot over Bryon Russell, of the Utah Jazz,                                                                                                                     |\\n|                    |        | in his final game with the Chicago Bulls in the 1998 NBA Finals.

The design was inspired by the North American X-15, which was developed by NASA during the 1950s. The sides of the XV were made from woven kevlar fiber. [25]  The Jordan XVs were Hatfield\\'s least favorite in the series. [38]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\\n| Air Jordan XVI     | 2001   | The shoe came with spats, and the design was inspired by performance cars and architecture. The ad campaign featured Mos Def. [25]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\\n| Air Jordan XVII    | 2002   | This pair of Jordans came with a multimedia CD-ROM containing the Air Jordan XVII song. The retail price of the shoe was US$200. [25]  The defining functional design element of the Air Jordan XVII model, which was later replicated on the Air Jordan XXIII model, was the reinforced mid-sole which provided a sturdy and stable chassis for the shoe. They were made in four mid top colors and three low-top colors. Michael Jordan wore the XVII while playing for the Washington Wizards, after his second retirement return. [41] The shoe was re-released in 2008 and 2016.                                                                                  |\\n| Air Jordan XVIII   | 2003   | The Air Jordan XVIII shoe was released during Michael Jordan\\'s last season, in which he played for the Washington Wizards. The shoe was designed by Air Jordan Senior Footwear Designer, Tate Kuerbis, who had been part of the Jordan footwear design team since 1999 and with Nike since 1995. The inspiration for the design came from the carbon fiber- based monocoque of F1 race cars, [25]  race car driving shoes (rubber heel wrap) and Fine Italian dress shoes (bold stitching on the soles). It was re-released in 2008.                                                                                                                                   |\\n| Air Jordan XXI     | 2006   | The Air Jordan XXI model of shoes was designed by D\\'Wayne Edwards and inspired by sport touring vehicles.
